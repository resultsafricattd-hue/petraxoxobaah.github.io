      <p>Petra,</p>
      <p>
       On your special day, I just want to pause and let you know how much you mean to me. Even with the distance that has been between us, the bond we share has always been closer than ever, and I know a big part of that comes from all the little-but-impactful moments we’ve shared.

      Your texts? They’ve been lifelines on tough days and sparkles on the good ones. I mean, I've suffered from a lotta dry texts, but I still appreciate the time you create for me nonetheless. The way we used to talk for hours in the middle of the night, to me... it seemed like the world just disappeared and it was only us. Those moments are permanently etched in my heart.

      And oh, the TikToks and reels! You never failed to find the most relatable, the most random videos that somehow felt so us, and the one that's dearest to my heart... the red thoughts and blue thoughts. From laughing like lunatics at 2 AM to sending “this is so you” tiktoks that made my day, you’ve always known how to make me smile.

      Thank you for being the kind of best friend who doesn’t need to be near to feel wanted or appreciated, despite the wrath that distance has put us through. I really treasure our memories more than you probably know, and I’m so grateful that the universe brought you into my life, though we never knew we could be like this from the start.

      Happy birthday, Petra. Here’s to more late-night calls, more red-thoughts(🌚), more love, and more of us.
      </p>

      <hr>
      <h2 class="second">Today</h2>
      <p>
       I just wanted to wish you a very happy birthday, my beautiful soul. Even though distance has kept us apart for God knows how many years, you’ve never felt far from my heart. Today, I’m sending you all the love, hugs, and warm wishes in the world because you truly deserve them and much more.

      You’ve been my safe space, my joy, and a light even on my darkest days. Though I've never been there physically in most of your birthdays, though I know you don't expect people to do anything for you on your birthday, I do know I’m celebrating you in spirit and the best of my heart—for the best person you've ever been to me, the amazing lady you are and all the strength, happiness, and love you carry with you.

      Here’s to the memories we’ve made and the ones still waiting for us, including the plans we've structured for us after SHS. I hope this year brings you everything you’ve been silently praying for. Never forget how deeply you are appreciated, and how much I care about you, my dear.

      Keep shining, Petra. My world has and will forever be a better place with you in it. Happy Birthday again. I miss you more than words can say, and I love you more than the mouth could even express them.
      </p>

        Big 18 huh? You’re officially grown now… meanwhile, I’m still stuck at 17, looking like your little brother (though I've always been. But don't judge the looks tho, I'm much more of my age than you think, and you know that). But it’s okay, I know I’ll catch up eventually. Just don’t forget me when you’re out there making grown "auntie" decisions. 😌

        You turning 18 hits different, not just because of the number, but because of everything it means — how far we’ve come, the person you’ve grown into, and all the dreams and plans we’ve been whispering about for after WASSCE.

        Remember those times where we planned everything? From getting our freedom, that one specific special gift you had for me (YOU BETTER TELL ME YOU REMEMBER), to chasing our goals together? I still hold onto all of that. I’m rooting for the version of us that actually gets to live those dreams — including your Maybach GLS — side by side, like we always said we would.

        You’re not just my best friend... you’re someone I want in my life forever. So yeah, go shine, celebrate, and enjoy being 18... but don’t forget, I’m still your little 17-year-old sidekick who’ll always be cheering you on (and of course teasing you as always).

        Here’s to forever... our dreams, our plans, and our friendship. I don’t know what the future holds but I hope it always in some way includes you in. Happy Birthday again, my Queen.💫
